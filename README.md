# WinEventViewerLib

WinEventViewerLib is a Python library for interacting with the Windows Event Viewer, allowing users to retrieve event logs, write events to the log and manipulates registry event sources.

# Prerequisites

To use WinEventViewerLib, you need to have the pywin32 library installed. You can install it using pip:

<code>pip install pywin32
</code>

# Notes
Ensure your script has the necessary permissions to access the Windows Event Viewer and modify the registry.
* Accessing and modifying the Windows Event Viewer requires read and write access to the event logs and may require administrative privileges.
* Registering and removing event sources involves writing to the Windows Registry, which typically requires administrative privileges.
* Writing events to the event log requires that the event source is already registered.
* Running scripts that interact with the Windows Event Viewer or registry may need to be executed with elevated permissions (Run as Administrator).
* For detailed usage of pywin32, refer to the PyWin32 Documentation.

# Security Warning
When using WinEventViewerLib, be aware that many operations require administrative privileges, including accessing and modifying the Windows Registry. Registering and removing event sources involves registry modifications that can cause system instability, so always back up the registry first.
